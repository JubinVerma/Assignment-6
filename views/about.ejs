Let me tell you something about the hardest game I have ever played, called Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. I attached a small video to the left for you. Keeping this short, it involves the incredible mix of combat that makes you feel like you are actually fighting, an in-depth story of a samurai protecting his young master in whom the blood of immortality flows, and the final battle against Isshin the Sword Saintâ€”a moment of pure bliss as he is the hardest boss in the game.</p>
